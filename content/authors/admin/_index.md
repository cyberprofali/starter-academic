I am a Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) focused on helping organizations design, mature, and sustain cybersecurity programs aligned with business risk, regulatory requirements, and real-world threat landscapes. My work spans cybersecurity strategy, governance, risk management, and executive advisory across industries including healthcare, education, and finance.

I bring a strong technical foundation informed by an offensive security background, allowing me to translate adversary behavior into practical, defensible security controls. Through risk assessments, security evaluations, and program development, I help organizations strengthen their security posture while moving beyond checklist compliance toward measurable, sustainable outcomes.

In addition to executive security leadership, I am actively involved in cybersecurity education and workforce development. I serve as Cybersecurity Faculty and Program Coordinator at Olive-Harvey College, where I design and lead hands-on, industry-aligned training programs focused on applied security skills. I have also served as an instructor and adjunct faculty member at institutions including ThriveDX, Illinois Institute of Technology, and Saint Louis University, teaching topics ranging from ethical hacking to digital forensics.

My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Computer Science, with research focused on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity, including AI-driven threat detection, adversarial machine learning, and security automation. I also hold dual Master’s degrees in Computer Science and Applied Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics, along with undergraduate degrees in Physics and Applied Mathematics.

With a blend of executive security leadership, deep technical grounding, and academic rigor, I bring a strategic and well-rounded perspective to cybersecurity program development, risk management, and security innovation.
